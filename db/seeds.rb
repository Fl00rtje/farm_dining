The land that I bought already had some pear trees on it, so in summer I can harvest pears. The potatoes I started growing because I'm a big fan of Dutch stamppot, stew. My friends like to come and join me for dinner when I make some. Stamppot boerenkool, kale stew, is their favorite! Maybe later I'll start growing kale as well. In my free time I love to take my dog to the forest and walk for a couple of hours. I try to do that every Sunday, we both enjoy it a lot. Apart from that I like biking, watching Netflix and having a drink with a friend.")
